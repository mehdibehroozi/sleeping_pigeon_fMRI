    "# Temporal filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "High pass filters cut off frequencies below a certain threshold which of course should below the lowest frequency of interest. Since in fMRI, noise is disproportionally expressed in low frequencies, high-pass filtering can also help whitening the noise (i.e. flattening the noise spectrum), which helps fulfilling GLM assumptions.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A very broad rule of thumb is to use a high-pass of 2-3x task frequency in task-based fMRI. The default in softwares ranges between 100-128 sec which is appropriate for trial length between 8-45 sec.\n",
